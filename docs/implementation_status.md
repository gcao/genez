# Gene Implementation Status

This document tracks the current implementation status against the design specification.

## Summary

Gene is a functional interpreter with a working 4-stage compilation pipeline (AST ‚Üí HIR ‚Üí MIR ‚Üí Bytecode). The core language features are implemented including functions, recursion, conditionals, macros, and a complete object-oriented programming system with methods on primitive values. The implementation takes a pragmatic approach, deferring advanced features like JIT compilation and garbage collection until the core language is more mature.

## Compilation Pipeline

### Design Specification
- 5-stage pipeline: AST ‚Üí HIR ‚Üí MIR ‚Üí LIR ‚Üí Bytecode/Native
- Dual execution paths (interpreted and compiled)
- SSA form in MIR for optimization

### Current Implementation
- 4-stage pipeline: AST ‚Üí HIR ‚Üí MIR ‚Üí Bytecode
- LIR stage is skipped
- MIR uses stack-based operations, not SSA
- Only interpreted execution path

### Recommendation
Keep the current 4-stage pipeline for now. The LIR stage can be added later when implementing JIT/AOT compilation. The current approach is simpler and working well.

## VM Architecture

### Design Specification
- Register-based VM with fixed-size registers
- Inline caches for property access
- Profile-guided optimization
- Three-tier execution (interpreter ‚Üí baseline JIT ‚Üí optimizing JIT)

### Current Implementation
- Hybrid approach: register-based bytecode with stack-based MIR
- Simple register allocation without optimization
- No inline caches or profiling
- Interpreter only

### Recommendation
The current register-based bytecode is a good foundation. Continue with this approach and add optimizations incrementally.

## Type System

### Design Specification
- Gradual typing with full type inference
- Property-based types with `^` syntax
- Union and intersection types
- Generic types with constraints
- Full OOP support

### Current Implementation
- Basic type enum in `src/core/types.zig`
- Value union type for runtime values
- Core class hierarchy implemented (Any, Number, Int, Float, String, etc.)
- Methods on primitive values working
- Basic type checking infrastructure (disabled by default)
- No property types or generics yet

### Recommendation
The type hierarchy is well-designed. Next steps should focus on:
1. Enabling and improving type checking in HIR
2. Implementing property types (`^` syntax)
3. Adding generics and type constraints

## In Progress üöß

1. **Type System**
   - Type checking infrastructure exists but not active
   - Runtime values support all basic types
   - Need to enable type checking by default

2. **Error Handling**
   - Basic error propagation in Zig
   - No language-level try/catch yet

## Not Started ‚ùå

1. **Advanced Compilation**
   - LIR stage
   - JIT compilation
   - AOT compilation
   - Optimization passes

2. **Memory Management**
   - Garbage collection
   - Reference counting option
   - Memory pooling

3. **Concurrency**
   - Actors
   - Channels
   - STM (Software Transactional Memory)

4. **Language Features**
   - Pattern matching (AST support only)
   - Modules and imports
   - Properties (`^` shorthand syntax)
   - Automatic constructor calls with arguments
   - do blocks returning last expression value
   - Float literal parsing
   - Method calls on literals (must use variables)
   - != operator parsing (method exists but parser doesn't support it)

5. **Standard Library**
   - Collections
   - I/O
   - Network
   - File system

## Recommendations

1. **Keep Current Architecture**: The 4-stage pipeline is working well. Don't add LIR until needed for JIT.

2. **Focus on Type Checking**: Enable the basic type checking that's already implemented in HIR.

3. **Improve Error Messages**: Add better error reporting with line numbers and context.

4. **Complete Pattern Matching**: The AST support exists, implement the runtime execution.

5. **Add Module System**: This is essential for larger programs and code organization.

6. **Defer Advanced Features**: JIT, GC, and concurrency can wait until the core language is more complete.

7. **Update Design.md**: Consider updating the design to reflect the current pragmatic approach while keeping the long-term vision.
