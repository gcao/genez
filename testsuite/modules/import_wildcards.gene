# Test wildcard import patterns (future feature)

# These patterns demonstrate potential wildcard syntax
# Currently not implemented in the parser

# Test 1: Import all from a module
# (import "math" *)  # Would import all exports
# (import "utils" * => u)  # Would import all with namespace prefix

# Test 2: Wildcard with exclusions
# (import "large_lib" * :except [internal private])

# Test 3: Glob patterns in paths
# (import "components/*.gene")  # All .gene files in components/
# (import "models/*")  # All modules in models/

# Test 4: Recursive wildcards  
# (import "src/**/*.gene")  # All .gene files recursively

# Test 5: Wildcard with specific imports
# This might be useful to import all + ensure specific ones exist
# (import "helpers" * [required1 required2])

# Test 6: Conditional wildcards (future feature)
# (import "plugins/*" :if available)

# For now, explicit imports are required:
# (import "math")  # Import with namespace
# (import "utils" => u)  # Import with alias

# Note: Wildcard imports can impact performance and clarity
# Best practice is to import only what you need
