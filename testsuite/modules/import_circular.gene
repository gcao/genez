# Test circular import detection (when implemented)

# This test documents how circular imports should be handled

# Example 1: Direct circular import
# File A: (import "./B")
# File B: (import "./A")
# Should be detected and reported as error

# Example 2: Indirect circular import
# File A: (import "./B") 
# File B: (import "./C")
# File C: (import "./A")
# Should also be detected

# Example 3: Self-import
# (import "./import_circular")  # Would be circular

# For now, just test that the syntax parses
