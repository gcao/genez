# This test documents current limitations of the module system
# These features are parsed but not yet executed

# 1. Namespace resolution not implemented
# (ns math
#   (fn square [x] (* x x)))
# (math/square 5)  # Would fail - namespace resolution not implemented

# 2. Import doesn't actually load modules
# (import "std/math")
# (math/sin 1.0)  # Would fail - imports not resolved

# 3. Namespaces don't create isolated scopes yet
# (ns test
#   (var x 10))
# (print x)  # Would work incorrectly - x would leak to global scope

# 4. Slash notation for namespace access not implemented
# (ns geometry
#   (class Point))
# (new geometry/Point)  # Would fail - slash notation not resolved
