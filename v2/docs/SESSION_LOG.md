# Gene v2 Development Session Log

This log tracks work done in each development session to maintain continuity.

## Session 2025-01-06: Initial v2 Setup

**Context**: Migrated from v1 after implementing pattern matching and OOP features. Decided to start fresh with v2 based on unified Gene data format.

**Work Completed**:
1. Created v2 directory structure
2. Migrated and refined design documents:
   - `architecture.md` - Overall v2 architecture
   - `unified_gene_migration.md` - Migration strategy from v1
   - `lir_design.md` - Low-level IR with Gene-specific operations
   - `vm_unified_design.md` - Register-based VM design
3. Implemented core Gene type (`src/gene.zig`):
   - Optimized storage with None/Single/Few/Many tiers
   - Property and children access methods
   - toString representation
4. Implemented value system (`src/value.zig`):
   - Value union with all types
   - SmallString optimization
   - Symbol type with interning
   - Basic heap object structures
5. Created test suite (`src/tests.zig`):
   - Gene creation and manipulation tests
   - Storage optimization tests
   - No memory leaks in tests
6. Created benchmark framework (`src/bench.zig`):
   - Property access: 2ns (Single), 9ns (Few)
   - Child access: 1ns
   - Gene creation: ~5Î¼s (needs optimization)
7. Set up CLI structure (`src/main.zig`):
   - REPL framework (echo mode)
   - Command line parsing
   - Test runner

**Key Decisions**:
- Use optimized storage tiers for properties/children
- Design for NaN-boxing (not fully implemented yet)
- Direct Gene AST generation (no intermediate AST)
- Focus on performance from the start

**Next Session Should**:
1. Implement lexer for Gene syntax
2. Start parser that generates Gene AST directly
3. Consider simple tree-walking interpreter first
